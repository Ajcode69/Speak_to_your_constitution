      "century, especially after First World War, with\n",
      "industrialisation and urbanisation has made the\n",
      "village a part of the wider economic system.\n",
      "M.S.A. Rao has identified three types of urban\n",
      "impact on villagers in India. Firstly, there are\n",
      "villages in which a sizeable number of people\n",
      "have taken employment in Indian cities and even\n",
      "overseas towns. They send money regularly to\n",
      "their families which are left behind in the\n",
      "villages. The money earned from urban\n",
      "employment is used to build fashionable houses\n",
      "in their villages and invested in land and industry.\n",
      "Donations are also made to the establishment of\n",
      "the educational institutions etc. All this increases\n",
      "the social prestige of their families. Thus the\n",
      "urban impact is felt by such villages even though\n",
      "they may not be physically situated near a city\n",
      "or town.\n",
      "The second kind of urban impact is seen in\n",
      "villages which are situated near an industrial\n",
      "town. Their lands ate totally or partially\n",
      "acquired. They receive an influx of immigrant\n",
      "workers which stimulates a demand for houses\n",
      "and market inside the village.\n",
      "The third type of impact on village is the growth\n",
      "of metropolitan cities. As the city expands it sucks\n",
      "the villages lying on the outskirts. Many villages48 THIRD CONCEPT , NOVEMBER 2020lose their land which is used for urban\n",
      "development. The villagers in these landless\n",
      "villages who get cash compensation may invest\n",

      "whose land has not yet been acquired or\n",
      "particularly acquired may engage in market\n",
      "gardening, dairy farming and poultry keeping.\n",
      "To sum up, we can say that the Indian village\n",
      "was not economically self -sufficient even in the\n",
      "British times. Industrialisation and urbanization,\n",
      "which began during British rule and gained\n",
      "momentum after independence, have made the\n",
      "village a part of the wider economic network.\n",
      "Planned development of the countryside has made\n",
      "further dent in the rural economy.\n",
      "Village and Caste and Kinship System\n",
      "The village consists of a vertical interdependence\n",
      "of castes, i.e., relationship among different castes.\n",
      "It is reflected in Jajmani system. But these vertical\n",
      "ties are cut across by the horizontal ties of cate\n",
      "and kinship, i.e., the relationship within the caste,\n",
      "which extend beyond the village to other village\n",
      "and even towns. One’s relative live in different\n",
      "villages and one has to interact with them on\n",
      "different occasions, like births, marriage and\n",
      "deaths. One may also have to depend on them\n",
      "for help in times of need. In north India where\n",
      "village exogamy exists along with caste\n",
      "endogamy, one has to look outside the village\n",
      "for a marriage partner for one’s son or daughter.\n",

      "Since caste endogamy is the rule one’s kin\n",
      "normally belong to one’s caste. Intra caste\n",
      "relations and other caste matters are regulated\n",
      "by a caste panchayat whose members belong to\n",
      "different villages. In pre British India, the\n",
      "horizontal expansion of caste ties was limited\n",
      "by the political boundaries of a number of small\n",
      "kingdoms as well as poor roads and\n",
      "communication. With the unification of the country\n",
      "brought about by the British and the introductionof better roads and railways, cheap postage and\n",
      "printing, there was a rapid spread in intra-caste\n",
      "relations because it was easier to keep in regular\n",
      "touch with each other.\n",
      "Thus we can say that the village has always had\n",
      "ties with other villages and towns for kinship\n",
      "and for caste purpose. This was limited in Pre-\n",
      "British India when communication was poor and\n",
      "small kingdoms existed whose boundaries acted\n",
      "as effective barriers. The horizontal spread of\n",
      "caste ties greatly increased during British rule\n",
      "and since independence it linked the village to a\n",
      "much wider area.\n",
      "Village and Religious System\n",
      "A study of the religion of any Indian village shows\n",
      "a double process of interaction at work between\n",

      "and ‘Parochialisation’ respectively to refer to\n",

      "interaction between the little and great traditions.\n",
      "M.N. Srinivas’s concept of Sanskritization also\n",

      "Sanskritic. Sanskritic elements are spread from\n",
      "the higher castes to the lower castes. The spread\n",
      "of Sanskritic theological ideas increased during\n",
      "British rule and after, due to the development of\n",
      "communications and spread of literacy. Western\n",

      "their relationship with rulers. Villagers could\n",
      "rebel and support a rival to throne. British rule\n",
      "changed the relationship between the village and\n",
      "the ruler.\n",
      "Political conquest was followed by the development\n",
      "of communications. This enabled the British to\n",
      "establish an effective administration. Government\n",
      "employees like the police, revenue official and other\n",
      "came to the village. The British established a system\n",
      "of law courts. Major disputes and criminal offences\n",
      "had to be settled in courts. This greatly reduced the\n",
      "power of the village panchayat.\n",
      "Since independence, the introduction of\n",
      "parliamentary democracy and adult franchise has\n",
      "made the village even more fully integrated with the\n",

      "members of local bodies like the gram panchayat\n",
      "but also elect members of the state legislature and\n",

      "of the Indian Union. There is interaction between\n",
      "these different levels of the political system.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "To sum up, we can say that, although the village\n",
      "has a definable structure and is a clear entity for the\n",
      "villagers themselves, it is also a sub- system within\n",
      "the larger political, economic, social and religious\n",
      "system in which it exists. In Pre British India the\n",
      "absence of roads and poor communications limited\n",
      "interaction between villages and between villages\n",
      "and towns. Nevertheless, the interaction was there.\n",
      "Even traditionally the village was not self-sufficient\n",
      "economically. Essential items were not produced in\n",
      "most of the villages and they had to visit weekly\n",
      "markets and towns for them. Again every village\n",
      "did not have all the essential artisans and servicing\n",
      "caste and there was mutual dependence between\n",
      "villages for this purpose.\n",
      "Socially too, the village has never been an isolated\n",
      "unit. Kinship and caste ties have extended beyond\n",
      "the village. This is more so in the north, where village\n",
      "exogamy is practised. With the unification of the\n",
      "country under the British rule the barriers to the\n",
      "horizontal spread of caste ties were removed. The\n",
      "building of roads and railways, cheap postage and\n",
      "printing press helped members of a caste spread\n",
      "over a large areas to keep in touch. Since\n",
      "independence the importance of votes in getting\n",
      "one’s candidate elected has further increased the\n",
      "horizontal unity of the caste.\n",
      "As far as the religion of the village is concerned a\n",
      "continuous interaction between the localised little\n",
      "tradition and the great tradition of Indian civilization\n",
      "takes place through the double process of\n",
      "universalisation and parochialisation.\n",
      "Politically, although in pre-British India the king was\n",
      "willing to allow villagers to govern themselves in\n",
      "day to day matter, the payment of a substantial\n",
      "portion of the produce was a symbol of villager’s\n",
      "dependence on the king. Besides, king performed\n",
      "several duties towards the villagers. The British\n",
      "brought most of the country under their rule. The\n",
